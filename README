Intro
=====
This is a fork and modified repo based on marcv81/proxdroid to support the latest proxmark3 v2.2.0 and android ndkv12

This is the proxmark3 for Android superproject. You'll need a proxmark3 board, a rooted Android device that supports the USB host mode, and a USB OTG cable to connect them. If your Android device does not power the proxmark3 board you may need an external power supply and a Y USB cable.

Devices known to work:
- HTC One V (PrimoU) (requires an external power supply)

Devices known to have issues:
- Samsung Galaxy S2 (the phone can send data to the proxmark3 board but no answer is ever received)
